// PS5 port (vk-285-102/103): GetThreadId (EE syscall 0x2f) answered from a cache while the running thread can't
// have changed. Shadow of the Colossus's heavy view makes ~143,000 GetThreadId calls a second (of ~315,000
// syscalls, vk-285-101's [eesys] line). Each one ran the kernel's exception entry, its syscall dispatch, the
// context restore and the ERET, and the ERET forced an event test 4 cycles on.
//
// The PS2 kernel changes threads only inside its exception handlers, which all leave through ERET. So:
// - seq counts every exception entry (cpuException) and every ERET;
// - an exception entry remembers where it came from (its EPC and the stack pointer); when the ERET that
//   follows (with no other exception in between) returns there -- EPC, or EPC + 4 after a syscall, with the
//   same stack pointer -- the same thread runs again: a cache that held before the exception still holds, and
//   an ERET that ends a GetThreadId call records v0's low 64 bits as the id;
// - an ERET anywhere else (another thread, a new thread's start) or a second exception before the ERET
//   leaves the cache stale until the next GetThreadId call goes to the kernel.
// vk-285-102 kept the cache only across the GetThreadId calls themselves (~60K of the 143K calls a second
// answered); vk-285-103 keeps it across the other syscalls and interrupts that return to the same thread.
// The cache answers unless flags/nohletid (vk-285-105: on by default, after vk-285-104's check mode found no
// mismatch in ~130,000 checks a second); with the flag every call goes to the kernel, and the calls the cache could
// have answered are compared with the kernel's answer ([eefast] checked/mismatched). v0's upper 64 bits are
// left as they are (the kernel's restore leaves the caller's there). Needs proper testing.
