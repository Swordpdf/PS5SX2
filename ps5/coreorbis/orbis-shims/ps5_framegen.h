// RPCS3-PS5 (m73): frame generation. AMD FSR3's frame interpolation (FidelityFX SDK 2.3.0, MIT) on plain Vulkan: from two frames
// of the game, the frame halfway between them, shown before the second one (a game held at 30 fps is shown at 60).
//
// A PS3 game gives no motion vectors or depth, so this is FSR3's optical flow path alone (FFX_FG_OF_ONLY in the shaders):
//   optical flow    the luma of each frame and its pyramid (7 levels), a block search from the coarsest level down with a filter
//                   and an upscale at each level (FSR3's "v5" optical flow), scene change detection from luma histograms
//   interpolation   the flow's vectors halved and pushed to where each block is halfway (the vector field); then (m73b) each
//                   pixel tries no motion, the field, its 4 nearest cells, its block's flow and (m73f) the 4 blocks' around it,
//                   (m74) its quad's motion in the last generated frame and the best of them refined to a fraction of a pixel,
//                   and keeps the motion under which the previous frame half a vector back and the current one half a vector
//                   ahead agree, a motion that is not the flow's own where it samples counting less (m73g); where none agrees
//                   (the edge of something in front), the sample another motion explains is dropped; a pixel unchanged for 8
//                   frames (HUD, text) does not move (docs/algorithm.md has the details)
// FSR3's passes for the game's motion vectors, the disocclusion mask and the inpainting are not run. The shaders are FSR3's HLSL
// compiled to SPIR-V (tools/build-shaders.sh, sources in shaders/); this file and its .cpp are
// the host side (the SDK's ffx_opticalflow.cpp and ffx_frameinterpolation.cpp redone on Vulkan, without the SDK's backend).
//
// No RPCS3 dependency: the host tool tools/fg-test.cpp runs the same code on a software Vulkan device.
//
// PS5SX2 (2026-10-08, AI-assisted): this copy comes from Swordpdf's RPCS3-PS5 / ps5-framegen (GPL-2.0-only there; relicensed by its
// author for PS5SX2) with two changes: the Vulkan commands are PCSX2's loader's (VKLoader.h), and the frames may be in another format
// than R8G8B8A8 (the swapchain's, so that PCSX2's present pipelines draw into them). Needs proper testing on ps5vk.
