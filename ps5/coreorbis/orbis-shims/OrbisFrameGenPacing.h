// PS5SX2 (vk-285-133, AI-assisted): frame generation's pacing, counted in the PS2's own vsyncs.

//
// vk-285-131 measured the game's frame interval on the wall clock, between presents. At 60 Hz that fed itself: once a
// generated frame had been shown (a slow first second was enough), it took a refresh of its own, so the game's frames came
// every two refreshes, which looked like a 30 fps game that should get a generated frame, and so on. Ratchet & Clank ran at
// 30 fps and half speed, with its GS and VU threads waiting on the display (2026-10-08, on the console).
//
// Here the interval is the number of PS2 vsyncs between two new frames of the game, which the presents can't change, and a
// frame's presents never exceed the display refreshes the PS2 gives it:
//     refreshes = vsyncs x display Hz / PS2 Hz
// The game's frame is one present. Frames are generated only when the game's frames have two refreshes or more (the median of
// the last 8 intervals: a 60 fps game on a 120 Hz display, a 30 fps one at 60 Hz), and the generated frame is presented for
// about half of them (once at 2, twice at 4, three times at 6); the game's frame stays up until the next one. A 60 fps game at
// 60 Hz gets none. A frame never gets more presents than its own interval had refreshes, less the presents already made in
// it (the game's last frame, a repeat GSRenderer.cpp still presented). While frames are generated, the vsyncs that only
// repeat the game's last frame present nothing (GSRenderer.cpp): the generated frame used their refresh. After a load or a
// pause (more than 8 vsyncs without a new frame) and at the start, 8 frames come before any is generated.
//
// The safety net: when the game runs below 95% of its target speed for 3 seconds while frames are generated, none are for
// 10 s. If the game is back at full speed (97%+) in that pause, they were costing it: the next pause is twice as long (up to
// 160 s; back to 10 s after 5 minutes without one). If it is as slow without them, the game is slow by itself there: frames
// are generated again, and for a minute that speed (less 3 points) is the floor. Nothing is generated while the frame
// limiter isn't at normal speed (turbo, slow motion, the fast boot). Header-only, so a PC test runs it (tests/fgpacing).
//
// vk-285-135: and only while the game's frame rate is steady: 7 of the last 8 intervals the same length to start, 6 to go on.
// swordpdf on vk-285-134d, Ratchet & Clank where its frames take 1 or 2 vsyncs (45-58 fps): "it felt like actually worse
// than 50". One generated frame before each of the game's on frames of uneven length makes the motion speed up and slow
// down from refresh to refresh, on top of the in-between frames' artifacts and the frame of lag; an even rate (60 to 120,
// 30 to 60) is what it doubles well. Uneven stretches show the game's own frames.
