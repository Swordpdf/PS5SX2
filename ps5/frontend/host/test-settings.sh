# PS5 port frontend: checks that the settings page and the shelf's options sheet write the same settings files
# (settings_test.cpp), that this tree's page answers as an older one did, and (vk-285-116) that the sheet lists the page's
# options (options_dump.cpp against options_parity.js, which needs node).
