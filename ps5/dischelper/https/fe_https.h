// PS5 port frontend: our own HTTPS GET client (2026-10-05, AI-assisted; needs proper testing on the console).
//
// After the jailbreak the console's libSceSsl can't reach its certificate store (sceSslGetCaList answers 0x80020002), so
// it trusts no site unless it is handed roots, and with roots it still can't follow a cross-signed chain: archive.org
// sends GoDaddy's Root G2 cross-signed by the old Class 2 root, and its download servers fail the same way. This client
// runs TLS itself with mbedTLS (ps5/third_party/mbedtls), checks every server's chain against Mozilla's roots (bundled,
// fe_https_roots.inc) and its name, and speaks enough HTTP/1.1 for downloads: redirects, ranges, chunked answers. The
// texture pack downloads use it (fe_ps5.cpp); the system's parts (DNS, the socket, random numbers) come from the
// platform, so the PC preview and the tests run it too.
